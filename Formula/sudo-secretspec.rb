  # The companion builds rusqlite against the system SQLite rather than the
  # bundled copy, which hangs in libsqlite3-sys on macOS. pkg-config finds it at
  # build time, and it resolves to Homebrew's sqlite rather than the one in
  # /usr/lib -- `otool -L` on the installed companion shows a link against
  # /opt/homebrew/opt/sqlite/lib/libsqlite3.dylib. So this is a runtime
  # dependency, not just a build one: declaring it `=> :build` would let
  # Homebrew remove sqlite and leave an installed binary that cannot start.
  depends_on "sqlite"
  # install.rs targets /private/etc and the sudoers boundary it manages is
  # macOS-only, so there is nothing for this formula to do on Linux.

    # The companion goes to libexec, which Homebrew does not link, so it never
    # lands on PATH. It is only a bootstrap: the binary you run day to day is
    # the one `sudo-secretspec install` places at /usr/local/bin, and that path
    # is what the sudoers policy and the installed manifest are pinned to. A
    # linked keg copy would shadow it with a same-version, different-hash
    # binary that `doctor` cannot currently detect.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Homebrew installed files only. It did not run sudo, edit sudoers, create
      users, or mutate /var/db. To opt in after reviewing the installed assets,
      explicitly run the bootstrap companion out of libexec:

        #{opt_libexec}/sudo-secretspec install --declarations /path/to/secretspec.toml

      That installs the client you use from then on at
      /usr/local/bin/sudo-secretspec. The libexec copy is deliberately not on
      PATH so it cannot shadow the installed client.

      Existing protected stores must be adopted explicitly; see
      sudo-secretspec/AI-GUIDANCE.md in the source distribution.
